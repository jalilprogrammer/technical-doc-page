             <p>Software engineering is a detailed study of engineering to the design, 
                development and maintenance of software.</p><br>
             <p>Software engineering was introduced to address the issues of low-quality software projects. 
                Problems arise when a software generally exceeds timelines, budgets, and reduced levels of quality.

             <p>
                A software product is judged by how easily it can be used by the end-user
                and the features it offers to the user.
                An application must score in the following areas:
             </p>
             <ul>
                <li>Operational: -This tells how good a software works on operations like budget
                    , usability, efficiency, correctness ,
                    functionality , dependability , security and safety.</li>
                <li>Transitional: - Transitional is important when an application is
                    shifted from one platform to another. So,
                    portability, reusability and adaptability come in this area.</li>
                <li>Maintenance: - This specifies how good a software works in the changing environment.
                    Modularity, maintainability, flexibility and scalability come in maintenance part.</li>

             <p>The job involves spending many hours at the keyboard, so high levels of concentration are required.
                Regular breaks are essential to minimise potential adverse health effects
                such as eye strain or back problems.</p>
             <p>The work is mainly office based or in computer laboratories</p>, <p>although full or part-time remote
                working is becoming increasingly common.</p><br>
             <p><strong>to be a software engineer you will work with one or more of programming languages such as</strong></p>
